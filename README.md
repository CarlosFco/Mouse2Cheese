A simple game made in Unity and Vuforia to teach kids (and not kids) computational thinking.

### Levels
1. Tutorial, very simple.
2. Following the first level structure, no loop or decisions.
3. Introduction to loops.
4. Loop level.
5. Introduction to decisions and planification.
6. Complex level with multiple paths.

Levels about loops have a question about the repeated pattern. For its part, levels with decisions asks which one was the shortest path.

### Player's guide
To play, when app launches the camera, just aim to an image inside the [Scanning Resources folder](https://github.com/CarlosFco/Mouse2Cheese/tree/master/ScanningResources) and the app will load the level with that figure.

The APK archive is in the [Mouse_2_Cheese_APK directory](https://github.com/CarlosFco/Mouse2Cheese/tree/master/Mouse_2_Cheese_APK), just download it in your Android Smartphone, install it and play!

Enjoy!
